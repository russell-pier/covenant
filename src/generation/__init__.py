World Generation Pipeline System

A highly tunable, layered generation system with three tiers:
- World: Large-scale features (lands/seas, climate, etc.)
- Region: Medium-scale features (biomes, terrain, etc.)  
- Local: Small-scale features (structures, details, etc.)

Each tier consists of multiple layers that process data in sequence.
